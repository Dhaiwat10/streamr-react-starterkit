# Streamr React Starterkit

This is a starter kit for building a React app powered by the Streamr network. I found this to be a bit of a pain to set up, so I made this starter kit to make it easier for others to get started.

## Tech stack

- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) (to handle the wallet connection properly)
- [Rainbowkit](https://rainbowkit.com) (for the wallet collection UI)
- [Streamr](https://streamr.network)
- `streamr-client` (for connecting to the Streamr network)
- `@lens-protocol/client` (for connecting to Lens Protocol)

## How to use

1. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `pnpm install`
2. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`

## Todo

- [ ] Add a demo for publishing data to the Streamr network
- [ ] Add a demo for Lens Protocol integration
